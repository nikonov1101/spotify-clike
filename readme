spotify-clike
=============

One-shot binary to "like" now playing song on Ppotify.

I terribly miss such a hotkey in default macOS client.
So I wrote this small app, and bound it to a hotkey using Karabiner.

Add the following piece into "~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json"
under $.profiles.complex_modifications.rules:

{
    "description": "Like current spotify track: Global + Control + L",
    "type": "basic",
    "from": {
        "key_code": "l",
        "modifiers": {
            "mandatory": [
                "left_control",
                "fn"
            ],
            "optional": [
                "any"
            ]
        }
    },
    "to": [ { "shell_command": "/Users/alex/go/bin/spotify-clike" } ]
}


How to use:
==========

1. register an application, and set its keys in "credentials/credentials.go" file.

2. run "go run auth/auth.go", follow the given link, and authorize your account.
The refresh token will be stored in ~/.spotify-token.json.

3. "go install" it, assign a hot-key, shell alias, or whatever you like.

4. like hundreds of tracks to properly taught Spotify's AI of your music taste.
